# 8. AI Integration (Future Possibility)

**Status: Experimental & Not Currently Integrated by Default**

> The AI integration features within ActionCore are experimental. As of the latest review, ActionCore is not initialized with AI-specific configurations by default through the Vuetify framework. Enabling and configuring AI integration would require custom setup when initializing ActionCore.

This document previously outlined how actions could be prepared for potential AI consumption. Key concepts included:

*   An `ai` metadata block in `ActionDefinition`.
*   A `parametersSchema` property in `ActionDefinition` for describing expected handler parameters.
*   A method like `actionCore.getDiscoverableActions()` for AI systems to query available commands.

If you are interested in exploring these capabilities, you would need to:

1.  Review the `ActionCore` source code for AI-related options and how to enable them during its direct instantiation or custom setup.
2.  Define appropriate `ai` metadata and `parametersSchema` for your actions.
3.  Implement the AI client-side logic to interact with `getDiscoverableActions()` and `executeAction()`.

**Security Note (Important for any AI Integration):**
Even if AI features are enabled, robust security checks (validation of `ActionContext.data`, authorization) **must always** be performed within each action's `handler` or `canExecute` function. AI discovery mechanisms control visibility, not execution security.
